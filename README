Scope
=====
lluvia Project is a javascript framework that intends to provide an object oriented ruby-like basis. It should help for building cool effects for web applications. 
In the near future, web shall be restful and stateless, so applications should keep track on the state. AJAX is also an emergent technology to keep in mind.

Peripheral works may involve some useful plugins for netbeans or aptana, as well as a translator from easier to write lluvia dialects.
